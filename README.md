# CS229-Assignments
My solutions to the problem sets of CS 229 Machine Learning Fall 2018, Andrew Ng, Stanford (YT Playlist). I did this course in the Summer of 2022.

These solutions are more or less complete. Some of the questions which went over my head have been left unsolved.

Key takeaways:

1. This was a math course in the guise of an ML course.
2. A fundamental course for breaking into theoretical ML and a solid foundation for specializations like CV, NLP etc.
3. Homework problems were not run-of-the-mill; each problem sought to teach more about the concept.
