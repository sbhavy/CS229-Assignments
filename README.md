# CS229-Assignments
My solutions to the problem sets of CS 229 Machine Learning Fall 2018, Andrew Ng, Stanford (YT Playlist).

These solutions are more or less complete. Some of the questions which went over my head have been left unsolved.

Key takeaways:

1. A fundamental course for breaking into theoretical ML.
3. My math sucks lol.
